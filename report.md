# Detailed Fraud Analysis Report (2024)

## Project Objective  
To analyze **fraud investigation cases** handled by 5 investigators across different fraud types observed in 2024, in order to uncover resolution delays, fraud cost drivers, seasonal patterns, and high-risk case types.  

**Focus Areas:**  
- Identifying unusual delays in resolving medium- and low-risk cases.  
- Highlighting gaps in case assignments (e.g., unassigned open cases).  
- Comparing fraud types by case count, total losses, and loss per case.  
- Detecting seasonal spikes (especially June and December).  
- Assessing correlation between loss amount and case severity.  

**In short:** Evaluating fraud investigation performance and fraud patterns to improve case resolution and resource allocation.

## Overview
The analysis covers:
- **1,000 transactions**  
- **5 investigators**: John Doe, James Brown, Maria Garcia, Jane Smith, Alex Johnson  
- **Fraud Types**: Phishing, Money Laundering, Fake Invoices, Unauthorized Access, Identity Theft  
- **Year**: 2024  


## Insights

### 1. Unusual Delays in Medium- and Low-Risk Fraud Case Resolution
- Some low- and medium-risk cases are taking **60+ days** to resolve, a duration typically expected of high-risk cases.  
- Possible causes:  
  - Resource allocation issues  
  - Backlogs or investigation issues  
  - Misclassification of case severity  


### 2. No Open Cases Assigned
- Currently, **no open cases are assigned** to any investigator.  
- Risks:  
  - Delayed investigations  
  - Increased backlogs  
  - Unresolved frauds  
  - Potential financial and reputational losses  


### 3. Fraud Type Analysis

| Fraud Type          | Cases | Loss Value       | Avg. Loss per Case |
|---------------------|-------|------------------|--------------------|
| Phishing            | 215   | 10,559,311.68    | 49,113.08          |
| Money Laundering    | 207   | 10,850,922.64    | 52,419.92          |
| Fake Invoices       | 206   | 9,899,404.90     | 48,055.36          |
| Unauthorized Access | 194   | 9,532,121.83     | 49,134.65          |
| Identity Theft      | 178   | 9,104,056.46     | 51,146.38          |

Key takeaways:
- **Money Laundering and Identity Theft** are the costliest per incident.  
- **Phishing** has the highest number of cases (215), but lower average loss per case.  
- **Fake Invoices** are frequent but least costly per case.
- Additional Insight: 
- Phishing (75 cases) and Unauthorized Access (74 cases) have the highest **high-severity** cases.  


### 4. Seasonality and Trend Analysis

- **Q2**: Highest fraud cases (272) and highest losses (13,253,670.18).  
- **June**: Peak month for both case count and financial losses → possible seasonal pattern.  

**Month-over-Month (MoM) Case Changes:**
- December: +24% (sharpest growth)  
- November: -23% (sharpest decline)
- Noticeable declines were also observed in:
- July: -12%  
- September: -9%  

**Month-over-Month (MoM) Loss Value Changes:**
- December: +34% (sharpest surge in losses)  
- September: -17%  
- November: -17%  

**Conclusions:**
- December = **highest risk month** (more cases + higher losses per case).  
- November = weakest month (sharpest decline).  
- Fraudsters likely prepare for year-end attacks.  
- Q3 (July–September) = relatively calm period → opportunity for system upgrades.  


### 5. Correlation Analysis
- **No correlation** found between Loss Amount and Case Severity.  


## Recommendations

### Fraud Types
- Enhance monitoring for **Money Laundering** and **Identity Theft** (e.g., unusual transaction patterns, synthetic identities).  
- Flag **large one-off transfers** inconsistent with normal behavior.  
- Expand **public awareness campaigns** (emails, social media alerts) to reduce phishing.  
- Maintain **strict invoice verification** and vendor audits; automate checks where possible.  
- Ensure invoices align with purchase orders, delivery notes, dates, and vendor details. Discrepancies → flag immediately.  


### Seasonal Trends
- Deploy **extra security resources** in **Q4**, especially mid-November to December.  
- Run **end-of-year scam awareness campaigns** for customers.  
- Analyze **mid-year fraud patterns** for early detection of emerging risks.  
- Use **Q3 (July–September)** for **system upgrades** and reinforcement.  
- Apply stricter **transaction limits, verification, or manual reviews** for high-value transactions in December.  
- Partner with **banks and payment providers** to flag unusual high-value year-end transactions.
